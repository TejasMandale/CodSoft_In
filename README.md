# Task 1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
# Name: Tejas Mandale
About the Dataset
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Objective:

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
